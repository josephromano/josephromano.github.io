\section{2. Wave Phenomena in Water and Air}

PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND

Wave motion is responsible for the propagation of sound. In this laboratory we
study various wave characteristics and how they are related to the production
and propagation of sound. We will take a look at {\em reflection}, 
{\em refraction}, {\em interference}, and {\em diffraction}. 
A ``ripple tank” with water waves is used to
simulate the properties of sound waves. A light source at the ripple tank
illuminates the waves so that they are visible. For actual sound waves we use a
two-speaker system to demonstrate interference.

THEORY AND EXPERIMENT

A wave is a periodic disturbance or fluctuation in a medium about its
equilibrium position. We use water waves as a good example. Waves transport
energy and can do work. A simple {\em sine wave} 
can be used to demonstrate important properties of waves. 
Figure~\ref{f:1} shows the {\em displacement} of the vibrating medium
(e.g., air, water, or a string) as a function of time. The horizontal axis is
time, and the vertical axis is displacement. The equilibrium position
is at $y=0$. The period $T$ is the time for one complete cycle, in other words the
time for a system to return to its initial position.

\caption{Displacement of the medium (e.g., water) of a wave from equilibrium 
as a function of time, for a fixed point of observation.}
\label{f:1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%

The frequency of oscillation is defined as the inverse of the period,
$f=1/T$.

The physical unit of frequency is {\em Hertz}, abbreviated Hz. 
The oscillation in Figure~\ref{f:1} 
has a period of $T = 0.10~{\rm s}$ and a frequency of $f = 10~{\rm Hz}$. 
For water, the molecules move up and down (transversely), while the wave 
itself travels in a direction perpendicular to the up and down motion. 
This kind of wave is called a {\em transverse traveling wave}. 
The {\em wavelength} $\lambda$ is the distance the wave travels 
during one ``up and down” cycle. 
It is the distance from any one crest
to the next nearest crest, or from wave trough to next trough, or between any
two corresponding points having the same {\em phase}---see Figure 2. 
If we call $v$ the wave speed, then we have
\be
v = \frac{\lambda}{T} = f\lambda\,.
\label{e:v=f*lambda}
\ee

the medium and horizontal direction the position of the wave.}

\subsection{Wave Velocity}

We can use a PASCO ripple tank to produce plane waves in the ``strobe
light" setting.
The direction of the traveling waves is perpendicular to the 
crests and troughs of the waves.

1. Set the PASCO ripple machine to a frequency setting of $f=20~{\rm Hz}$ and use the strobe function to snap shot the wave pattern. \\
2. Trace 6 consecutive wave crests. \\
3. Measure the length of the consecutive crests and determine the wavelength $\lambda$ by 
dividing the length by 5. \\
4. Use this wavelength $\lambda$ to calculate the velocity $v$ of the wave. \\
5. Repeat these steps for  $f=15~{\rm Hz}$ and  $f=25~{\rm Hz}$ and fill in the table. \\
%
\begin{table}[hbtp]
\begin{center}
Wave Velocities\\
\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c | c | }
\hline
Frequency & \phantom{ }5 wavelengths\phantom{ } & wavelength $\lambda$ & \phantom{ }velocity $v$\phantom{ } \\
\hline
$f$=15 Hz &  &  &  \\
\hline
$f$=20 Hz  &  &  &  \\
\hline
$f$=25 Hz  &  &  &  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
%\caption{Table}
\label{t:1}
\end{center}
\end{table}

For waves in shallow water, we can also calculate their velocity using the equation $v = (gd)^\frac{1}{2} $, where $ g = 9.8~{\rm m/s}^{2}$ and $d$ is the depth of the water. Calculate the velocities for the three frequencies above. Compare the values for velocity between the two methods of calculation. Consider and discuss sources of error for each of the two methods.

\subsection{Reflection}
%
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{fig2_3}
\caption{Incoming wave reflected off a smooth surface.}
\label{f:3}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%
When sound waves hit a barrier such as a wall, some of the sound is reflected
(with the rest absorbed by the wall). 
Waves obey the {\em law of reflection}. 
A line
drawn perpendicular to a point on the wall is called the ``surface normal”---see
Figure 3. The angle that the incoming wave makes with the normal is called the
{\em angle of incidence}. The law of reflection states that for a wave approaching a
barrier, the wave will be reflected from the surface at an angle equal to the
angle of incidence. For the law of reflection to hold, the surface roughness
must be small compared to the size of the wavelength. In other words, we need a
smooth, or optically speaking, a ``mirror-like” surface. This is the case in
our experiments with the ripple tank.

Reproduce a similar plane wave reflection using the PASCO ripple machine. Using the strobe function, trace the wavefronts before and after reflection.  

\subsubsection*{Questions}

1.	 Use your tracing of the wavefronts and the law of reflection to calculate the incoming and reflected wave angles. Attach your tracing and measurement to the end of the handout.

\subsection{Interference of Waves}

When two or more wave trains move through the same region of space, the waves
interfere with each other at any given spot. 
{\em Constructive interference} occurs
when two waves with the same phase, such as two wave crests, align at the same
location. The two amplitudes add together to create a ``hotspot” of twice the
amplitude and thus a maximum in intensity---see Figure~\ref{f:5}.
%
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{fig2_5}
\caption{Interference and superposition of two waves. 
The diagram on the left
shows {\em constructive} interference and on the right 
{\em destructive} interference.}
\label{f:5}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%

On the other hand, if the wave crest of one wave meets with a wave trough of
another wave, the two waves are completely out-of-phase and suffer 
{\em destructive interference}. The resultant amplitude is nearly zero, and so is the wave
intensity---again see Figure~\ref{f:5}.


\subsubsection{Interference of Water Waves}

We can study the interference maxima and minima with water waves in the 
``ripple tank” using the wave generator with two small point-like dippers, 
each producing circular waves. 
If we space the plungers a few wavelengths apart, and choose a 
frequency between 15 and 20 Hz, we observe the interference pattern
similar to that shown in Figure~\ref{f:6}.
The radial lines correspond to regions of destructive interference
where the two circular waves cancel each other out (e.g., at the top 
black dot in Figure~\ref{f:6}).
Between those radial lines are regions of constructive interference
(e.g., at the bottom black dot in Figure~\ref{f:6}).
%

\label{f:6}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%

\subsubsection*{Questions}

2.	 Suppose we change the frequency of the dippers.
Describe how the interference pattern changes.
(For example, does increasing the frequency of the 
dippers increase or decrease the number of radial 
lines in the interference pattern.)
\\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Interference of Sound Waves}

Sound waves from two speakers behave exactly like the 
interfering water waves in the ripple tank shown
in Figure~\ref{f:6}.
For interference from the speakers to be clearly audible, 
the wavelength should be somewhat smaller than the distance between the speakers.
By walking in front of the speakers, you can hear the
interference maxima (constructive interference) and 
minima (destructive interference) as you walk.

\subsubsection*{Questions}

3.	 At the midpoint in front of the speakers (i.e., at the 
same distance from each speaker) would you hear 
constructive or destructive interference? Why?
\\
\\
\\
\\
4.	 Would the number of audible maxima and minima 
increase or decrease if the frequency is increased?
\\
\\
\\
\\
5.	 Do you think the interference of sound waves is desirable 
or undesirable in rooms and concert halls?  
Why? How would you address such problems?
\\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Diffraction of Waves}

Diffraction is a wave phenomenon with direct applications to sound propagation
when there is a barrier, opening, or corner. The effect is pronounced when the
wavelength is comparable to the size of the obstacle. In such cases diffraction
enables one to hear sound ``around corners”---see Figure~\ref{f:7}. 
We all have heard
sound from a door opening when we were outside a room but not in the
line-of-sight of the sound source inside.
%
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{fig2_7}
\caption{Diffraction of sound waves after passing through an opening, 
around a barrier, and around an edge.}
\label{f:7}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%

The amount of diffraction depends on the relative size of the wavelength
of the waves and the size of the opening or barrier obstructing the 
passage of the waves.
For example, suppose a wave approaches a barrier with a width large
compared to the wavelength.
Then there is a ``shadow” region without waves behind the barrier, 
as expected. 
If, however, the wavelength is comparable to the barrier width, the 
``shadow” region behind the barrier becomes small and waves travel into 
that region.

P.S. Water waves are an example of {\em transverse waves}, 
whereas sound waves are {\em longitudinal waves}. 
In the first case the medium (water) oscillates {\em transversely} to 
the direction of wave propagation; in the second case (air) the 
oscillations are {\em longitudinal} along and against the 
propagation direction. 
These differences do not affect the basic study of wave behavior in this laboratory.

\subsubsection*{Questions}

6. For the case of plane waves incident on an opening, sketch the 
diffracted waves for the case where the wavelength of the waves is 
small compared to the size of the opening.
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\

7. Same as the previous question but for the case where the 
wavelength of the waves is comparable to the size of the opening.
