Lab 1 solutions

Part I
------
1) the length of the pendulum; the mass of the ball

2) the period for the longer pendulum is approximately 2x larger than 
than for the shorter pendulum

3) 3x larger

Part II
-------
1) Period is proportional to square root of the mass

Part III
--------
1) the period decreases by a factor of 2 for 4x tension

2) the fundamental frequency increases by a factor of 2 for 4x tension

Part IV
-------
1) 1:1 - unison
   5:4 - major third
   3:2 - fifth
   2:1 - octave
