Lab 2 solutions

Part I
------
1) v = f*wavelength where f=20 Hz and wavelength = 0.11 m/5; so 
   v = 20*0.11/5 = 0.44 m/s

Part II
-------
1) Using angle of incidence = angle of reflection, the incident
parallel rays will be reflected through a focal point (like for a 
converging mirror)

Part III
--------
1) Sound propagation is refracted downward (away from the normal) as 
sound travels from lower elevations (cooler air) to higher elevations 
(hotter air).  This looks like an upside-down U-shaped curve.

Part IV
-------
1) Adding two sine waves that are 90 degrees out of phase with one 
another produces another sine wave with same frequency, but with an
amplitude sqrt(2)x larger and phase shifted by 45 degrees

Part IV.A
---------
1) Increasing the frequency will increase the number of radial lines.
The wave velocity is unchanged, so the wavelength decreases.

Part IV.B
---------
1) Constructive interference, because the sound waves travel the same
distance from the two speakers.

2) If the frequency is increased, the number of audible maxima and 
minima would increase.

3) Interference of sound waves is undesirable in rooms and concert 
halls since you don't want regions of enhanced or diminished sound.
By adding many reflecting surfaces between the sources of the sound
and the listener, the sound field becomes more homogeneous, making it
less likely to have regions of total constructive or destructive
interference.

Part V
------
An opening can be thought of as two barriers placed next to one 
another.

1) For wavelengths << the size of the opening, the waves pass through
with very little spreading into the shadow regions of the opening.

2) For wavelengths comparable to the size of the opening, the waves 
spread into the shadow regions of the opening.
