\section{4. Air Resonance}

PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND

The concept of {\em resonance} in a pipe is similar to that of a string. The waves in
a pipe consist of compressions and rarefactions of the air, with back-and-forth
motion of the air molecules in the direction of propagation or against it. The
waves in air are thus {\em longitudinal} waves. In this laboratory we study standing
waves in a pipe. They are the result of two waves traveling in opposite
directions inside the pipe, with each wave being reflected at the ends of the
pipe. In this way the superposition of two waves yields a standing wave,
provided that, in addition, the {\em resonance conditions} are met.

For a pipe with both ends open, resonance at the {\em lowest} frequency 
({\em fundamental frequency} or {\em first harmonic}) 
occurs when there are anti-nodes of the air motion
at the ends – and only there, with a single velocity node at the center, see
Figure~\ref{f:1}. 
The motion of air molecules is highest at the anti-nodes and lowest at the nodes.

\caption{Air molecule displacement in an open and closed pipe.}
\label{f:1} 
\end{center} 
\end{figure}
%
For a pipe with one end closed and one end open, resonance at the lowest
frequency occurs when we have a velocity node at the closed end and an
anti-node at the open end. Plotted in Figure~\ref{f:1} is the displacement or velocity
of air molecules as a function of position along the pipe. The two curves for
each pipe in Figure~\ref{f:1} are one-half period of oscillation apart.

For the pipe with both ends open, we have $L = \lambda/2$ according to 
Figure~\ref{f:1}. 
For the closed pipe we have $L = \lambda/4$. 
The fundamental frequency is given by
%
\be
f_1 = \frac{v}{\lambda} = \frac{v}{2L}
\quad(\text{both ends open})\,,
\qquad
f_1 = \frac{v}{\lambda} = \frac{v}{4L} 
\quad(\text{one end closed})\,,
\ee
%
where $v$ is the velocity of sound.

\subsubsection*{Questions}
\ben
\i For a pipe with both ends open, what are the formulas for the fundamental
frequency and the frequencies $f_2$, $f_3$, $f_4$ of the next three overtones or harmonics?
(Hint: Higher harmonics have frequencies that are integer multiples of the
fundamental, and all integers are allowed for a pipe with both ends open.)

\i
For a pipe with one end closed and one end open, we have $L = \lambda/4$ 
according to Figure~\ref{f:1}. 
Write down the equations for the fundamental frequency and for the
first three existing overtones. 
(Hint: {\em Only odd integers are allowed} as you can see by extending 
the drawings in Figure~\ref{f:1} to higher harmonics.)

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

In the lab, we can record the frequency spectrum of sound in a pipe
using the setup shown in Figure~\ref{f:2}.
(This figure is specifically for a tube that is open at both ends.)
The speaker produces {\em white noise} and the ``FFT Analyzer Tool"
of Electroacoustic Toolbox can be used to record the spectrum.
Figure~\ref{f:3} shows sample recorded frequency spectra for both 
types of tubes.

\caption{Set up of the resonance tube in the ``open tube” configuration. White
noise from the Mac mini is applied to the speaker. The sound
enters the tube on the left and excites the resonances. The microphone on the
right records them for display on the computer. In the ``closed tube” 
configuration the speaker and microphone must be on the same (right) side.}

$L_{\rm eff,\ closed} = L_{\rm eff,\ open}/2 = 0.70~{\rm m}$ 
(with a plug in the tube to shorten its length). 
The fundamental frequency for both tubes is $f_1 = 121~{\rm Hz}$, 
but only the odd harmonics are observed in the tube closed at one end.}

\subsection{Pipe Length Correction and Determination of the Speed of Sound}

If you were to compare the calculated and observed
fundamental frequencies from an actual experiment,
you would find that they do not agree very well.
This has to do with the fact that, in pipes, waves 
reflect from the ends of the tube by sticking out a little bit. 
There is an end correction that increases the wavelength. 
This correction is proportional to the radius of the tube. 
Therefore, the larger the tube radius, the more the wave 
will ``stick out” and cause an increase in wavelength. 
This correction results in an extra length $\Delta L$, 
given from theory by $\Delta L = 0.61 r$ for each open end, 
where $r$ is the radius of the pipe. 
Thus for a closed pipe and open pipe of length $L$ and 
radius $r$, the effective lengths are, respectively,
%
\be
L_{\rm eff,\ closed} = L + 0.61 r\,,
\qquad
L_{\rm eff,\ open} = L + 1.22 r\,.
\label{e:Leff}
\ee

\subsubsection*{Questions}
\ben
\i Calculate the effective lengths of a closed and open
tube if $L=131~{\rm cm}$ and the diameter of the tube
is $d=14.4~{\rm cm}$.  
(Recall: The diameter  $d$ equals twice the radius $r$.)

\i Determine the velocity of sound using the data in 
Figure~\ref{f:3} for the resonance tube open at both ends.
The fundamental frequency is $f_1 = 121~{\rm Hz}$ and the
corrected pipe length is $L_{\rm eff,\ open}=1.40~{\rm m}$.

\i How does your value compare with the value of 
$346~{\rm m/s}$ expected for the speed of sound at
at a temperature of 25~Celsius?
If there is a discrepancy, what might be the reasons?

\subsection{Experiments with the Large Cardboard PASCO Packing Tube}

We can do additional experiments with the large brown cardboard packing 
tube from PASCO in order to study resonance and the decay of sound intensity. 
We close one end of the tube with a plug. 
Just by holding a microphone near the top of the tube, 
we can see a peak in the acquired FFT frequency spectrum. 
This peak corresponds to the resonating fundamental, which gets excited just from
the broadband background noise in the room. The tube acts as a resonator that
picks out its resonance frequency from the ambient noise and responds much less
to the other frequencies in the noise.

We can also tap the tube with its closed end on the floor to excite the 
tube resonances more strongly than just from the ambient noise. 
We can listen to the resulting resonance and record the
frequency spectrum with the microphone and the FFT mode in the Electroacoustics
Toolbox as usual. 
An example of such a resonance curve is shown in Figure~\ref{f:4}.
Note the absence of the even harmonics for a tube closed at one end.
%
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{fig4_4}
\caption{Frequency spectrum from a cylindrical PASCO packing tube, 
tapped on the floor with the closed end. 
The large peak is the $N =1$ harmonic (fundamental frequency), 
the small peak is the $N =3$ harmonic. 
The $N =2$ harmonic is missing, as is to be expected for a tube closed at one end.}
\label{f:4} 
\end{center} 
\end{figure}
%

Finally, we can record the {\em waveform} of the damped oscillation using 
the Oscilloscope Tool in Electroacoustics Toolbox.
Figure~\ref{f:5} shows the decay of the signal as a function of
time after tapping the tube on the floor at time t = 400 ms. The waveform
closely resembles a {\em damped sine wave}.

\caption{Decaying waveform of the packing tube.}
\label{f:5} 
\end{center} 
\end{figure}
%

\subsubsection*{Questions}
\ben
\i Look at the observed waveform in Figure~\ref{f:5} and 
estimate the so-called {\em exponential decay time}. 
This is the time it takes for the signal to decrease to
37\% of its original value.

\i An aboriginal {\em didgeridoo} has a length $L=120.5~{\rm cm}$
and a diameter $d=4.2~{\rm cm}$.
When you blow into a didgeridoo, it behaves like a tube closed at one end.
Calculate the expected fundamental frequency of the didgeridoo
using the appropriate corrected pipe length and $v=346~{\rm m/s}$
for the velocity of sound.

\subsection{Helmholtz Resonator}

We can also do experiments with a simple spherical cavity 
called a {\em Helmholtz Resonator}. 
In the lab, 
we have a large hollow metal sphere, with a tube protruding 
from one side for admitting white noise from a computer speaker. 
It has another smaller tube on the opposite side for 
listening to the resonance frequency or for recording the 
frequency spectrum with a shotgun microphone on a long shaft 
that can be inserted into this tubing---see Figure~\ref{f:6}.
%
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.65\textwidth]{fig4_6}
\caption{Experimental setup for a spherical Helmholtz resonator.}
\label{f:6} 
\end{center} 
\end{figure}
%

Even without any white noise excitation, one can listen to 
the sound from the Helmholtz resonator when exposed to ambient 
room noise.
It is a deep rumbling tone, corresponding to the resonant 
frequency of the spherical cavity. 
The resonance is excited from the broad noise spectrum in the room. 
Hermann Helmholtz (1821-1894) used a series of such 
``Helmholtz Resonators” of different sizes to analyze the 
frequency spectrum of sounds and musical instruments, 
all before the advent of electronic tools!

A resonance frequency spectrum from the Helmholtz resonator
using a white noise excitation is shown in Figure~\ref{f:7}.
It has one prominent peak.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{fig4_7}
\caption{Helmholtz resonance curve from a large aluminum sphere. The measured
and calculated values of the resonance frequency at the peak are 92 Hz and 93
Hz, respectively.}
\label{f:7} 
\end{center} 
\end{figure}
%

\subsubsection{Calculation of the Resonance Frequency of a Helmholtz Resonator}

The resonance frequency of a Helmholtz resonator is given by the formula%
\be
f=\frac{v}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{A}{L_{\rm eff} V}}\,,
\label{e:helmholtz}
\ee
%
where $v$ is the velocity of sound, $A$ is the area of the opening of the 
resonator, $L_{\rm eff}$ is the effective length of the cylindrical neck, and 
$V$ is the volume. 
This formula is quite general and can by used for spheres, bottles, etc.

P.S: If you have a Helmholtz resonator such as a box with just a hole in it,
rather than a ``bottle neck”, you can still use formula~(\ref{e:helmholtz}). 
For the actual length we have $L = 0$. 
But $L_{\rm eff}$ is not zero. 
The hole is open at both ends. 
So we can use 
$L = 0$ in equation~(\ref{e:Leff}) and obtain 
$L_{\rm eff} = 1.22r$ for the hole.

\subsubsection*{Questions}
\ben
\i The radius of the sphere is $R=0.150~{\rm m}$, the length of the ``bottle neck" is 
$L=0.080~{\rm m}$ and its inner radius $r=0.041~{\rm m}$.
Given these values calculate the values for 
$A$, $V$, and $L_{\rm effective}=L+1.22 r$ needed in equation~\ref{e:helmholtz}.
(Hint: For a sphere with a cylindrical neck, $A=\pi r^2$ and $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3$.)
Then calculate the resonance freqeuncy $f$ using $v=346~{\rm m/s}$ for the 
velocity of sound.

\subsubsection{Helmholtz Resonance in Bottles}

Distinct Helmholtz resonances can be obtained by blowing 
gently across the opening of different bottles. 
The resonance frequency can be measured from a 
frequency spectrum as in Figure~\ref{f:7} (for the 
large aluminum sphere) or 
Figure~\ref{f:8} (for a 0.75-liter wine bottle).
It can also be calculated from equation~(\ref{e:helmholtz})
once we determine $A$, $L_{\rm eff}$, and $V$.
For $A$ we use the average cross-sectional area of the
bottle neck.
For $L_{\rm eff}$ we use the measured length $L$ of the 
bottle neck with a correction for the tube being open at 
both ends.
The volume $V$ can be read off from the label on the bottle.

%

\subsubsection*{Questions}
\ben
\i Calculate the expected resonance frequency for a 
0.75~liter wine bottle given the following data:
The volume $V= 0.75~{\rm liter} = 0.75\times10^{-3}~{\rm m}^3$.
The average radius at the middle of the bottle neck 
is $r_{\rm avg} = 10.53~{\rm mm} = 0.01053~{\rm m}$.
The actual length of the bottle neck is
$L = 8.5~{\rm cm} = 0.085~{\rm m}$. 
For the length correction at the un-baffled outside opening 
at the top of the bottle neck take $0.61 r_{\rm avg}$, 
and for the baffled opening inside the bottle take 
$0.85 r_{\rm avg}$ (from physics theory). 
Thus the effective length of bottle neck is given by 
$L_{\rm eff} = L +(0.61 + 0.85) r_{\rm avg} = 
0.085 + 1.46 \times 0.01053 = 0.1004~{\rm m}$. 

Given all these values calculate the resonance frequency
for the wine bottle.

\i By how much does the calculated resonance frequency
differ from the measured frequency shown in Figure~\ref{f:8}?
Express the difference as a percent difference
%
\be
\text{percent difference} = 
\frac{|f_{\rm calculated}-f_{\rm measured}|}{f_{\rm measured}} 
\times 100\,.\ee

\i Calculate the frequency ratio $f_{\rm 1~liter}/f_{\rm 2~liter}$
for a 1-liter and 2-liter wine bottle, assuming that the only thing 
that differs for the two bottles is their volume.
This frequency interval is called a ``tritone" or ``devil's tone".
