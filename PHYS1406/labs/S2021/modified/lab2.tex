\section{2. Wave Phenomena in Water and Air}

PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND

Wave motion is responsible for the propagation of sound. In this laboratory we
study various wave characteristics and how they are related to the production
and propagation of sound. We will take a look at {\em reflection}, 
{\em refraction}, {\em interference}, and {\em diffraction}. 
A ``ripple tank” with water waves is used to
simulate the properties of sound waves. A light source at the ripple tank
illuminates the waves so that they are visible. For actual sound waves we use a
two-speaker system to demonstrate interference and diffraction.

THEORY AND EXPERIMENT

A wave is a periodic disturbance or fluctuation in a medium about its
equilibrium position. We use water waves as a good example. Waves transport
energy and can do work. A simple {\em sine wave} 
can be used to demonstrate important properties of waves. 
Figure~\ref{f:1} shows the {\em displacement} of the vibrating medium
(e.g., air, water, or a string) as a function of time. The horizontal axis is
the time, and the vertical axis is the displacement. The equilibrium position
is at $x=0$. The period $T$ is the time for one complete cycle, in other words the
time for a system to return to its initial position.

The frequency of oscillation is defined as the inverse of the period,
$f=1/T$.

The physical unit of the frequency is {\em Hertz}, abbreviated Hz. 
The oscillation in Figure~\ref{f:1} 
has a period of $T = 0.10~{\rm s}$ and a frequency of $f = 10~{\rm Hz}$. 
For water, the molecules move up and down (transversely), while the wave 
itself travels in a direction perpendicular to the up and down motion. 
This kind of wave is called a {\em transverse traveling wave}. 
The {\em wavelength} $\lambda$ is the distance the wave travels 
during one ``up and down” cycle. 
It is the distance from any one crest
to the next nearest crest, or from wave trough to next trough, or between any
two corresponding points having the same {\em phase}---see Figure 2. 
If we call $v$ the wave speed, then we have
\be
v = \frac{\lambda}{T} = f\lambda\,.
