COURSE SYLLABUS\\
PHYS 5306: ``Classical Dynamics"\\
Fall 2020\\
\end{center}

{\bf Instructor:}
Joseph D. Romano\\
Office: Science 14, Phone: 806-834-6522, E-mail: joseph.d.romano@ttu.edu

{\bf Lectures:}
PHYS 5306: TTh 12:30~PM - 1:50~PM, (online)

{\bf Office hours:}
TTh 2:00~PM - 3:30~PM, and by appointment (online)

{\bf Recommended textbooks:}\\
``Mechanics" (3rd edition) by L.D.~Landau and E.M.~Lifshitz\\
``Classical Mechanics" by M.J.~Benacquista and J.D.~Romano

{\bf Course Description:}
Lagrangian dynamics and variational principles. Kinematics and dynamics of
two-body scattering. Rigid body dynamics. Hamiltonian dynamics, canonical
transformations, and Hamilton-Jacobi theory of discrete and continuous systems.
M.S.\ and Ph.D.\ core course.  

{\bf Learning Outcomes:}
Students should be able to thoroughly understand the concepts and
methods of classical mechanics. Students are expected to be
able to apply key physics principles to explain and solve problems,
at the graduate level, in this area of physics.

{\bf Outcome assessment:} 
The expected course outcomes will be assessed through problem solving 
in class and on exams.

{\bf Course website:}
Blackboard \url{https://ttu.blackboard.com/}.

{\bf Class participation}:
Solving problems is probably the most important part of 
this course.
Although you won't have graded homework assignments, you will 
work on suggested problems throughout the semester.
There will be unannounced ``pop" quizzes in class from time to time 
to make sure that you are up-to-date with the material.

{\bf Exams}:
There will be two written midterm exams and a comprehensive 
oral final (see `Course Calendar' for dates).
No make-up examinations will be given. In the case of a
serious emergency, please see me to discuss how the final
grade will be determined.

{\bf Grading:}\\
Class participation: 20\%\\ 
Midterm x 2: 60\%\\
Final (oral): 20\%\\ 
Total: 100\%\\
Number grades will be converted to letter grades as follows:\\
A: 100-80; B: 79-60; XX: 59-50; C: 49-30; F: 29-0\\ 
with the XX borderline case determined primarily by class participation.

{\bf REQUIRED SYLLABUS LANGUAGE:}

{\bf Required Use of Masks/Facial Coverings by Students in Class}:
The Texas Tech University System has implemented a mandatory Facial
Covering Policy to ensure a safe and healthy classroom experience.
Current research on the COVID-19 virus suggests that there is a
significant reduction in the potential for transmission of the virus
from person to person by wearing a mask/facial covering that covers
the nose and mouth areas. Because of the potential for transmission of
the virus, and to be consistent with the University’s requirement,
students in this class are to wear a mask/facial covering before,
during, and after class. Observing safe distancing practices within
the classroom by spacing out and wearing a mask/facial covering will
greatly improve our odds of having a safe and healthy in-person class
experience. Any student choosing not to wear a mask/facial covering
during class will be directed to leave the class and will be
responsible to make up any missed class content or work.

{\bf COVID-19 related items}:

a. If Texas Tech University campus operations are required to change
because of health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is
possible that this course will move to a fully online delivery format.
Should that be necessary, students will need to have access to a
webcam and microphone for remote delivery of the class. 
%Additionally, students will need to have access to 

b. Policy on absences resulting from illness (see Attachment A.).

c. Policy statement on positive test (to be available soon).

d. Requesting accommodations as a result of personal health concerns
(see Attachment B.). 

{\bf Academic Honesty (OP 34.12)}:
It is the aim of the faculty of Texas Tech University to foster a
spirit of complete honesty and high standard of integrity. The attempt
of students to present as their own any work not honestly performed is
regarded by the faculty and administration as a most serious offense
and renders the offenders liable to serious consequences, possibly
suspension. 

“Scholastic dishonesty” includes, but it not limited to,
cheating, plagiarism, collusion, falsifying academic records,
misrepresenting facts, and any act designed to give unfair academic
advantage to the student (such as, but not limited to, submission of
essentially the same written assignment for two courses without the
prior permission of the instructor) or the attempt to commit such an
act.  

The full policy is available at
\url{http://www.depts.ttu.edu/opmanual/OP34.12.pdf} 

{\bf Special Accommodation for Students with Disabilities 
(OP 34.22):} 
Any student who, because of
a disability, may require special arrangements in order to meet the
course requirements should contact the instructor as soon as possible
to make any necessary arrangements. Students should present
appropriate verification from Student Disability Services during the
instructor's office hours. Please note: instructors are not allowed to
provide classroom accommodations to a student until appropriate
verification from Student Disability Services has been provided. For
additional information, please contact Student Disability Services in
West Hall or call 806-742-2405.

{\bf Student Absence for
Observance of a Religious Holy Day (OP 34.19):}

\ben
\i “Religious holy day”
means a holy day observed by a religion whose places of worship are
exempt from property taxation under Texas Tax Code §11.20.  

\i A student who intends to observe a religious holy day should make that
intention known in writing to the instructor prior to the absence. A
student who is absent from classes for the observance of a religious
holy day shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an
assignment scheduled for that day within a reasonable time after the
absence.  

\i A student who is excused under section 2 may not be
penalized for the absence; however, the instructor may respond
appropriately if the student fails to complete the assignment
satisfactorily.
