* All the noise files present the noise amplitude, which has units of Hz^{-1/2}. The square of this gives the one-sided noise PSD.

2nd gen

(i) aLIGO_noSRM.txt - aLIGO with no signal reycling mirror
(ii) aLIGO_ZeroDet_HighP.txt - aLIGO in zero detuning high laser power mode
(iii) aLIGO_ZeroDet_LowP.txt - aLIGO in zero detuning low laser power mode
(iv) KAGRA_VRSED.txt - KAGRA in early detuned mode
(v) KAGRA_VRSED.txt - KAGRA in broadband science mode
(vi) AdVirgo_noise.txt - Advanced Virgo noise

3rd gen

(i) ETB.dat - ET noise curve projection based on conventional technologies
(ii) ETC.dat - ET noise curve in xylophone mode
(iii) ETD_LF_HF_Tot.dat - ET noise curve in xylophone mode (updated and more realistic; 2nd column is LF instrument, 3rd column is HF instrument, 4th column is combined)

I imagine we will use aLIGO_ZeroDet_HighP.txt, KAGRA_VRSED.txt, and AdVirgo_noise.txt as our standard noise curves in any analysis.
